1. Create react app
2. Install __redux__ `install redux react-redux` to connect react and redux together
3. Installed redux-devtools-extension

__STORE__ - holds data of application
__ACTION__ - describes what I'm gonna do
__REDUCER__ - describes how actions transform the sate into the next state

ACTION is going to be called => REDUCER is going to check which action have been done and based on that action it's going to modify => STORE

DISPATCH - way to actually execute actions e.g. dispatch that action to reducer
