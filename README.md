<!-- STORE - holds data of application -->
<!-- ACTION - describes what I'm gonna do -->
<!-- REDUCER - describes how actions transform the sate into the next state -->

<!-- ACTION is going to be called => REDUCER is going to check which action have been done and based on that action it's going to modify => STORE -->

<!-- DISPATCH - way to actually execute actions e.g. dispatch that action to reducer -->
